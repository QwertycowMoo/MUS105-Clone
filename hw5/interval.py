## A class that implements musical intervals.
#
#  An Interval measures the distance between two Pitches. Interval distance
#  can be measured in different ways, for example using lines-and-spaces,
#  semitones, ratios, or cents. In western music theory an interval distance is
#  measured using 'span' (number of lines and spaces) and 'quality' (a chromatic
#  adjustment to the size). The Interval class supports the standard interval
#  names and classification system, including the notion of descending or
#  ascending intervals and simple or compound intervals.
#  Intervals can be numerically compared for their size (span+quality) and
#  can be used to transpose Pitches.
#
#  An Interval contains four integer attributes:
#  * span  The number of lines and spaces the interval moves (0-7).
#  * qual  The quality of the interval (0-12).
#  * xoct  The 'extra octaves' spanned by compound intervals (0-10).
#  * sign  1 for ascending intervals, -1 for descending.
#
#  See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)


class Interval:
    ## Creates an Interval from a string, list, or two Pitches.
    #  * Interval(string) - creates an Interval from a pitch string.
    #  * Interval([s, q, x, s]) - creates a Pitch from a list of four
    #  integers: a span, quality, extra octaves and sign. (see below).
    #  * Interval(pitch1, pitch2) - creates an Interval from two Pitches.
    #
    #  @param arg If only arg is specified it should be either an
    #  interval string or a list of four interval indexes.  If both
    #  arg and other are provided, both should be a Pitch.
    #  @param other A Pitch if arg is a Pitch, otherwise None.
    #
    # The format of a Interval string is:
    #  @code
    #  interval  = ["-"] , <quality> , <span>
    #  <quality> = <diminished> | <minor> | <perfect> | <major> | <augmented>
    #  <diminished> = <5d> , <4d> , <3d> , <2d> , <1d> ;
    #  <5d> = "ooooo" | "ddddd"
    #  <4d> = "oooo" | "dddd"
    #  <3d> = "ooo" | "ddd"
    #  <2d> = "oo" | "dd"
    #  <1d> = "o" | "d"
    #  <minor> = "m"
    #  <perfect> = "P"
    #  <major> = "M"
    #  <augmented> = <5a>, <4a>, <3a>, <2a>, <1a>
    #  <5d> = "+++++" | "aaaaa"
    #  <4d> = "++++" | "aaaa"
    #  <3d> = "+++" | "aaa"
    #  <2d> = "++" | "aa"
    #  <1d> = "+" | "a"

    # method (see below). If the input is two pitches they will be passed to the private
    # _init_from_pitches() method (see below).  Otherwise (if the input is not
    # a string, list of four integers, or two pitches) the method will raise a TypeError

    # method will raise a ValueError for that value. If all values are legal the method will
    # make the following 'edge case' tests:
    # * span and quality values cannot produce negative semitones, i.e. an interval
    #   whose 'top' would be lower that its 'bottom'. Here are the smallest VALID
