     This agrees with both the melodic and counterpoint rule that the starting note of the soprano
    must be a tonic, dominant, or mediant.

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=66, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=66, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.
    It does seem to disagree showing that (9), the submediant, is a common tone to start the piece on.
    This may be because of pickups or not starting on the tonic chord.
    --Actually this analysis is wrong because (9) is the tonic of the minor mode

* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    This rule agrees with the Laitz rule that melody (especially in the soprano) should be stepwise.
    This also agrees with the Laitz rule that the melody should end on a tonic note (which would be consonant
    with the bass, a I chord).

* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    This histogram agrees with the Laitz rule of resolving the tendency tones, especially within a dominant chord.
    The condition is the subdominant, which almost always resolves to the mediant.
    This also agrees with Laitz's rule of keeping stepwise motion within the melody and saving leaps for interest.

    Yes, This follows the Laitz rule of stepwise motion within the voices.
    As well, it agrees with the idea of chordal leaps as embellishments, resolving from the dominant(7)
    to the tonic(0) or mediant(4).

* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?

    This agrees with the rule that the leading tone should resolve to the tonic, and if not, should move
    stepwise down.
* Does this histogram disagrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=66, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=66, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.
    All rules with pid=66 ngram=2 are very similar in stepwise motion.

    Starting pitches, consonance
* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    This agrees with the Laitz counterpoint rule that the bass should start on the tonic while the soprano(melody)
    should be on the tonic, mediant, or dominant. This is a clearer rule than [ pid=68, ngram=1 ] because having
    the condition being the starting note removes possibilities for the bass and soprano.
    --Melodies should start on the tonic triad--

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=68, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=68, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.
    It seems to break the rule of direct fifths, skipping from an octave separation to most commonly a separation of a fifth.

    Parallel motion and consonant intervals
* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    It agrees with the Laitz guideline that parallel motion with imperfect consonant intervals is recommended.
    This also seems to relate to the idea of oblique motion and chordal leaps, moving from a third to a fifth.
    --but can still move to perfect consonants--

* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    It does not seem to follow any of Laitz's guidelines, but seems to encourage oblique motion from a o5 or +4 to a
    consonant interval of m3 or M3.
    --Tritone resolution--
* Does this histogram disagrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=68, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=68, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.
    This disagrees with [ pid=68, ngram=1 ] because the separation of a 6 is inherently a dissonant interval that should
    be resolved to a fifth(7) in counterpoint.

[ pid=68, ngram=2, cond=7 ]

    Motion, resolution
* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    This rule agrees with the counterpoint idea of moving from perfect consonant interval to an imperfect consonant interval,
    avoiding parallel perfects. As well, it also captures the possibility of resolution from V to I, a separation of
    a fifth to an octave which is allowed if done by step in one of the voices.
    This rule also allows movement in major and minor keys.

    Tonic, chords,
* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    Yes, it agrees with the rule that the melody must start on the tonic, mediant, or dominant. This extends
    to the bass and the other voices because voices must be consonant with each other, creating an implicit
    rule that a piece should start on its I/i chord. The two most common starting chords according to this histogram
     is the major I chord or the minor i chord.

    It does not.

* What concepts are considered here (use music language, e.g. music terms)?
    Tonic, Dominant, prolonging harmony, embellishing harmony, cadence, phrase model
* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    Yes, this histogram agrees with the rule that a melody should end on its tonic, and extending this to all four voices
    where a piece should end on its tonic chord at the end of an authentic cadence.
    It also agrees with the guideline of extending harmonies for musical interest, moving from I to I7.
    This histogram also agrees with the idea of phrase models and cadences, possibly moving from I to V(2,7,7,11) as a half cadence
    or I to IV(0,5,5,9), following the tonic to predominant motion.
* Does this histogram disagrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=157, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=157, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.
    It seems odd that I can move to I7, especially because I7 is a MM7, but this may be just to extend the tonic.

    Cadences, prolonging harmony
* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    This agrees with the rule that an authentic cadence should move from V to I(0,0,4,7) or move through
    the I chord as a cadential 64 chord.
    As well, the V can be extended in harmony by moving to V7(2,5,7,11).

[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=157, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=157, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.
    The rest of the histogram has a lot of edge cases that I assume we have not learned yet in theory.
    This rule is similar to the [ pid=157, ngram=2, cond=0,0,4,7 ] in its idea of chordal movement

* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    This agrees with the rule that a V7 chord should resolve to the I chord; the leading tone(11) to tonic(1),
    the dominant(7) to tonic(0), the subdominant(5) to mediant(4) and the supertonic to the tonic(0) or mediant(4).
    This movement also follows the voicing for an authentic cadence.
* Does this histogram disagrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=157, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=157, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.
    This rule strays a little from the correct way to resolve a V7 which gives a tripled tonic and the mediant while
    omitting the dominant note. Both of the most common results on the histogram include the dominant note, which can
    only be used with the frustrated leading tone.

    Applied chords, resolution, raised leading tone in minor
* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    This agrees with the rule of applied chords resolving to their resolution. This chord(2,4,8,11) is a
    V7/vi or V7 in minor, and it resolves to either the vi in major or i in minor (0,4,9,9). However,
    the histogram also shows that this chord can resolve to the major VI chord(1,4,9,9) as possibly an applied
    chord in the minor key.
* Does this histogram disagrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
[Hints:] You may want to compare it to [ pid=157, ngram=1 ] and then other [ pid=157, ngram=2, cond=... ]s.
    This chord resolving to (0,5,9,9) seems odd because it would be an augmented chord. We do not use augmented
    chords unless it is a suspension or embellishment that would resolve.
    --(1,4,9,9) is picardy third--
