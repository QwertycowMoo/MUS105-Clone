  This rule follows the idea that bass must be lower than tenor which must be lower
  than alto which must be lower than soprano. This idea is usually called voice crossing.

    Not necessarily, the rule seems to say that the soprano line likely to be a C, E, or G. However,
    because Bach composed in many keys, this may just be random.

    This rule finds the difference between the soprano keynum and the bass keynum. It seems to be similar
    to the rule that a voice cannot be more than an octave apart from each other, excluding the bass which
    can have a separation of an octave and a fifth. The most common separation between bass and soprano
    is between 15-24, which is between 2 and 3 octaves, enough for 2 other voices to fit inbetween the bass
    and soprano.

    This rule involves the bass and soprano and seems to find that consonant intervals (separation of
    5(perfect fifth), 3, 4(maj/min third), 0(octave), 8, 9(maj/min sixth)) are more common than the dissonances
    of seconds, sevenths, perfect and aug fourths. This agrees with the rule that counterpoint must
    involve consonant intervals and only use dissonances as embellishments.

    This agrees with the Laitz guideline that the upper voices cannot be more than an octave apart.
    It also agrees with the rule that the Alto must be higher than the Tenor and that voice crossing is observed.

    It is similar to the Laitz guideline that consonances must be used on strong beats and dissonances
    must be reserved for embellishments. While this rule only concerns the tenor and alto, if both voices are consonant
    with the bass, then the voices should also be consonant with each other if you also include the perfect fourth(?).

    This disagrees with Laitz in the fact that the tenor and alto should have any relation with each other.

    This histogram shows that these tetrachords commonly have a repeated note voiced in the soprano.
    As well, the notes also commonly form a major or minor triad. This follows the rule that diatonic
    triads should be used in four part writing. Augmented and diminished triads are less common and used
    for embellishments. Inversions are also used, and it seems that the root and first inversions are
    more common, which lines with the rule that 64 chords should only be used in specific cases.

    This is very similar to pid=196 where major or minor triads are used to create the parts.
    It is easier to see that inversions that are in root or first position are more common than
    the second inversion chords. Both major and minor chords are used.

    This histogram agrees with the idea that major or minor chords are the basis of part writing.
    These chords should be diatonic with the key and the separations show that it is so.
* Does this histogram disagrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?

    The second most common entry in the histogram does not agree with the structure of major,
    minor, diminished, or seventh. This is not diatonic with the key and disagrees with the rule
    that part writing should be diatonic.
