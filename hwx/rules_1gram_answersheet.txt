    The idea of voicing, bass, tenor, alto, and soprano
* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
    If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
  This rule follows the idea that bass must be lower than tenor which must be lower
  than alto which must be lower than soprano. This idea is usually called voice crossing which should not be violated.

    This rule does not necessarily agree or contradict with any of Laitz's rules, but it seems to
    say that the tonic, dominant, mediant, and dominant 7th are very common tones to find in the soprano.
    This may be because these notes are most commonly consonant with the Tonic, Subdominant, and Dominant
    function chords. Other notes would be used as embellishments rather than structural tones.

    It seems odd that the submediant(9) occurs as much as it does, but that may be because it is
    consonant with the tonic chord and the third of the subdominant.

* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?

    This rule seems to state that the tones of the tonic as well as the submediant are important to the alto voice.
    This agrees with the idea that notes should be consonant with the chord in counterpoint. This analysis is based
    on the idea the the tonic, subdominant, and dominant function chords are the most common and that the tonic(0), median(4),
    and the dominant(7) are consonant with these chords.
* Does this histogram disagrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    There is no counterpoint rule from Laitz that says one cannot use the (3) or (10) in the alto voice,
    and this analysis applies to pid 66, 61, and 60. It is only that it is uncommon to use these dissonant tones,
    but they can be used for embellishments

    consonant with the bass.

    See analyses above. The bass usually has tones that are diatonic to the key, unless there
    are inversions of applied chords.

    Spacing

    This rule finds the difference between the soprano keynum and the bass keynum. It seems to be similar
    to the rule that a voice cannot be more than an octave apart from each other, excluding the bass which
    can have a separation of an octave and a fifth. The most common separation between bass and soprano
    is between 15-24, which is between 2 and 3 octaves, enough for 2 other voices to fit inbetween the bass
    and soprano.

    Some occurances have separations of 7 or 31, which is very close or too much separation for a four part chorale

  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    This rule involves the bass and soprano and seems to find that consonant intervals (separation of
    5(perfect fifth), 3, 4(maj/min third), 0(octave), 8, 9(maj/min sixth)) are more common than the dissonances
    of seconds, sevenths, perfect and aug fourths. This agrees with the rule that counterpoint must
    involve consonant intervals and only use dissonances as embellishments.

    This agrees with the Laitz guideline that the upper voices cannot be more than an octave apart.
    It also agrees with the rule that the Alto must be higher than the Tenor and that voice crossing is observed.

* Does this histogram agrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?

    It is similar to the Laitz guideline that consonances must be used on strong beats and dissonances
    must be reserved for embellishments. While this rule only concerns the tenor and alto, if both voices are consonant
    with the bass, then the voices should also be consonant with each other if you also include the perfect fourth(?).
    As well, the inner voices have a less likelyhood of being an octave because of the voice spacing
* Does this histogram disagrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?

    This disagrees with Laitz in the fact that the tenor and alto should have any relation with each other.

    This histogram shows that these tetrachords commonly have a repeated note voiced in the soprano.
    As well, the notes also commonly form a major or minor triad. This follows the rule that diatonic
    triads should be used in four part writing. Augmented and diminished triads are less common and used
    for embellishments. Inversions are also used, and it seems that the root and first inversions are
    more common, which lines with the rule that 64 chords should only be used in specific cases.

    This is very similar to pid=196 where major or minor triads are used to create the parts.
    It is easier to see that inversions that are in root or first position are more common than
    the second inversion chords. Both major and minor chords are used.

    This histogram agrees with the idea that major or minor chords are the basis of part writing.
    These chords should be diatonic with the key and the separations show that it is so.
* Does this histogram disagrees with one or multiple rules you learned in a music theory class?
  If so, what are they? (preferably with a reference, e.g. Laitz page x Rule/Guideline y)
    The second most common entry in the histogram does not agree with the structure of major,
    minor, diminished, or seventh. This is not diatonic with the key and disagrees with the rule
    that part writing should be diatonic.
