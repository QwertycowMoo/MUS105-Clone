#  Instructions:
#    * for each of the functions below, read the docstring and implement the function as described.
#    * feel free to to add helper functions, but DO NOT MODIFY the descriptions of the original functions.
#
#    * absolutely NO import statements should be added, they will result in an automatic 0 (the autograder
#    will break)
#
#    * Some functions specify that certain built in functions may not be used. BE WARY OF THIS.
#
#    * if for whatever reason, an implementation detail is unclear, feel free to email:

def str_to_int(num_string):
    """
    Turn a string into an integer. For this function, num_string can be a string representation of a number in either
    binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal. Depending on the base, the string will start differently:
        binary:      "0b100" = 4 "0b" is first 2 characters
        octal:       "0o11"  = 9 "0o" is first 2 characters
        decimal:     "10"    = 10 no extra characters
        hexadecimal: "0xa"   = 10
     For binary, octal, and hexadecimal, the string will always be longer than 2 (i.e. the base prefix, and then the
     number. No matter the base, you are to correctly convert the string to an int and return it.

     If the base is unrecognized (the first two are not numbers, and also are not '0b', '0o', or '0x', the function
     should return -1.

    Don't worry about negative numbers!

    **hint** remember that the int() function can take multiple parameters. What was that second parameter?

    A christmas tree with size n is defined as a string having n + 1 rows, where the i'th row contains the (i-1)'th row's
    number of stars + 2, arranged in a symmetrical manner. the 0'th row should have 1 star. the last (n'th) row should
    be equivalent to the 0'th row (the trunk of the tree). the stars are asterisks: '*'. size is always >= 2.

    Example of a size 4 tree:
       *
      ***
     *****
    *******

    be spaces before the '*'s on each row, but not after.

    size 4 tree as string:

    **hint** print out your tree to the console a few times to make sure the spacing is correct.

    Implement the __str()__ function for the list class. This function should take a list, and convert
    it to its string representation. You can assume that for each element in the list, the str() function

              implement this. this is the only special case you should be aware of
